magnetic_Script
===============

This is the scripts I created to model the magnetic force applied to the cells for the work:

Laura R. Geuss, Douglas C. Wu, Divya Ramamoorthy, Corinne D Alford, Laura J. Suggs (2014). Effect of Magnetically Mediated Strain on Mouse Embryonic Stem Cell Differentiation into Cardiomyocytes (In preparation)

All input parameters are stored and can be changed in the main script: magnetic_field.m

The output of the scripts are:
1. 4x6 plots of force acting on the cells in each well of a 24 well plate
2. a pile of image that represents the forces acting on the cells at each time point
3. a pile of image that represents the magnet movement
