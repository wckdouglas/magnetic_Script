magnetic_Script
===============

This is the scripts I created to model the magnetic force applied to the cells for the work:

Laura R. Geuss, Douglas C. Wu, Divya Ramamoorthy, Corinne D Alford, Laura J. Suggs (2014). Effect of Magnetically Mediated Strain on Mouse Embryonic Stem Cell Differentiation into Cardiomyocytes (In preparation)

All parameters are stored in the main script: magnetic_field.m
