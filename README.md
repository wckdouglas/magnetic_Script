magnetic_Script
===============

These are the scripts I created to model the magnetic force applied to the cells for the work:

[Laura R. Geuss, Douglas C. Wu, Divya Ramamoorthy, Corinne D Alford, Laura J. Suggs (2014). Paramagnetic Beads and Magnetically Mediated Strain Enhance Cardiomyogenesis in Mouse Embryoid Bodies. PloS one](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0113982)

All input parameters are stored and can be changed in the main script: magnetic_field.m

The output of the scripts are:
1. 4x6 plots of force acting on the cells in each well of a 24 well plate
2. a pile of image that represents the amplitude of forces acting on the cells at each time point
3. a pile of 3D image that represents the magnet movement
4. a pile of 2D image that represents the magnet movement
